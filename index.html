                <p class="s-para">A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations (computation) automatically. Modern digital electronic computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. A computer system is a nominally complete computer that includes the hardware, operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment needed and used for full operation.</p>

            <p class="sec-tag1 s-para"> Water plays an important role in the world economy. Approximately 70% of the freshwater used by humans goes to agriculture.[9] Fishing in salt and fresh water bodies has been, and continues to be, a major source of food for many parts of the world, providing 6.5% of global protein.[10] Much of the long-distance trade of commodities (such as oil, natural gas, and manufactured products) is transported by boats through seas, rivers, lakes, and canals.

            <p class="sec-tag1 s-para"> The Kia Sportage is a lineup of sport utility vehicles manufactured by the South Korean manufacturer Kia since 1993 through five generations. Initially a compact SUV built on a body-on-frame chassis, the second-generation Sportage transitioned to a car-based platform which placed it into the compact crossover SUV class, and has been developed alongside the Hyundai Tucson. Since the fifth-generation model launched in 2021, Kia developed the Sportage in two sizes with different wheelbase lengths for different markets.

            <p class="sec-tag1 s-para"> The Innova is the replacement for wagon versions of Kijang (internally known as the Toyota Utility Vehicle), which was also marketed under different names such as Tamaraw FX/Revo, Unser, Zace and Condor. Like the outgoing Kijang, the first two generations (2004â€“2022) of the Innova are rear-wheel-drive vehicles built on the body-on-frame chassis shared with the Hilux pickup truck and the Fortuner SUV under the IMV project, instead of the unibody construction commonly used by MPVs of its era. The chassis was adopted due to the perceived strength and durability which are preferred by customers mainly in Indonesia
